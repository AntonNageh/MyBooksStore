Hello There,
It's my First project with React so I'm sorry for the bad code, no comments and bad UI (I tried my best..)
Here is a few things you will notice/should know :
1- I've used React-vite to create this project (Better performance/faster than create react-app)
2-Please don't forget to type "npm install" so everything goes well.
3-You'll need to type "npm run dev" instead of "npm start" to start the project.
4- Also I've used Material UI + bootstrap, I created the project with bootstrap but I learned about (Discovered) Material UI 
on the last day working on this project.
5-Finally, I really gained alot from this project and I hope everyone out there keep safe and keep developing (programming) : ) .

Made with love.
Thank you.
